# bachelorProject_DavidLiebemann_ProceduralTreeGeneration
Bachelor Project presenting the implementation of two different methods for the procedural generation of tree-like structures for the Unreal Engine 4.

Lindenmayer-Systems and a Space Colonization Algorithm.
A Lindenmayer-System - in short: L-System - is an extension of context free
grammars which replace parts of a given string by other strings, according to a predefined ruleset.

The functionality of the Space Colonization Algorithm is biologically motivated
by the competition for space between growing branches. 

Additionally, the project includes the graph-theoretical tree
data structure used by us and the system responsible for constructing the 3D model
data.
